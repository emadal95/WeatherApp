# WeatherApp

Flutter Development Exercise - Emanuele D'Alessandro

**Requirements**:

1. *Weather Data Integration*:

    - Integrate with a weather API such as Open Meteo (<https://open-meteo.com/>) to fetch current  weather data and forecasts.
    - Retrieve and display data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions (e.g.,  sunny, rainy).
    - Use a state management solution (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, Scoped Model) to manage the  app's state effectively.
    - Demonstrate proper separation of concerns between UI and state management.

2. *Location-based Weather*:

    - Automatically fetch weather data based on the user's location.
    - Allow users to manually enter a location to view its weather information.

3. *Current Weather Screen*:

    - Display the current weather conditions for the selected location.
    - Include details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions. - Show an icon or image reflecting the current weather state.

4. *Testing*:

    - Write unit tests for critical functions and widgets.
    - Ensure proper functionality of weather data retrieval, component rendering, and error  handling.

**Bonus**:

1. *User Preferences*:

    - Implement a settings screen to allow users to customize app preferences, such as length of  forecast.
    - Include options for setting the default unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit).

2. *Geolocated Search*:

    - Integrate with a location search API or package. Flutterâ€™s package repository (pub.dev) has a  number of free OpenStreetMaps and Google Maps location search packages available 3. Hourly and/or Daily Forecast:
    - Provide an hourly forecast for the next 24 hours.
    - Display temperature, conditions, and any relevant information in an organized manner. - Present a 5-day weather forecast with high and low temperatures, conditions, and an icon  representing each day.

**Submission**:

    - Share your code repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
    - Please include the apk in your repository
    - Include clear instructions on how to run the app and the tests.

**Evaluation Criteria**:

    - Code organization and structure.
    - Proper use of Flutter widgets and state management.
    - Implementation of core features.
    - Testing coverage and effectiveness.
    - Bonus points for additional features and clean, maintainable code.
